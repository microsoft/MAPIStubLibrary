# MAPIStubLibrary
The MAPI Stub Library is a drop in replacement for mapi32.lib which supports building both 32 and 64 bit MAPI applications. This library eliminates the need to explicitly link to MAPI.

**See the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/how-to-link-to-mapi-functions) for information on building the MAPI Stub Library and integrating it into your project.**\
**See the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) for questions about this library, such as when and why to use it.**
