# MAPIStubLibrary
The MAPI Stub Library is a drop in replacement for mapi32.lib which supports building both 32 and 64 bit MAPI applications. This library eliminates the need to explicitly link to MAPI.

**See the [documentation](https://mapistublibrary.codeplex.com/documentation) for information on building the MAPI Stub Library and integrating it into your project.**
**See the [FAQ](https://mapistublibrary.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=FAQ) for questions about this library, such as when and why to use it.**
